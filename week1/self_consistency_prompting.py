You must solve the problem step-by-step and ensure your final calculation is correct.

Example 1:
Problem: Jane has 10 apples. She gives 2 to her friend and eats 1. How many are left?
Reasoning: 
1. Initial apples: 10
2. Given away: 10 - 2 = 8
3. Eaten: 8 - 1 = 7
Answer: 7

Example 2:
Problem: A 100-mile trip has a stop at mile 30. Another stop is 10 miles before the end. Distance between stops?
Reasoning:
1. First stop: 30 miles
2. End of trip: 100 miles
3. Second stop: 100 - 10 = 90 miles
4. Distance between: 90 - 30 = 60 miles
Answer: 60

Now, solve the user's problem using the exact same logic.
End your response with "Answer: <number>" on the very last line.
